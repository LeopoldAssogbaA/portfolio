    An eclectic mix of musical genres, Groove Hill draws much inspiration from African-American music.
    Having grown up during the same times, the five musicians have channelled different inspirations into a modern fusion of soul, jazz, funk and hip hop.
    Their desire to create a unique and original sound drew them together. Social and ethical themes dominate their lyrics, sung in English, and delivered by a passionate singer.
    The soft tones of the trombone and catchy groove rhythms form the band's signature sound, with samples featuring at times.
